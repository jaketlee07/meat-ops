"""select-policy-families — turn a work-loop phase into its policy families.

Reads the registry block from `references/policy-families.md`, selects the
families a phase teaches, and prints one delivery record as JSON on stdout.

Selection only. This script never assembles a dispatch brief and never decides
whether a policy was obeyed; `assembled_brief_digest` is declared and left null
for the slice that performs assembly.

Usage:
    select-policy-families.py --registry <file> --root <dir> <selection-key>

`--root` resolves a family's `module` locator. It is the tree the acting agent
reads, which is not always the tree the registry was read from: an adapter
projection carries the skill but no seeds.
