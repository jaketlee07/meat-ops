"""Check that every finding a checker can emit is exercised by some test.

The defect this detects. A rule-based checker emits one distinct message per
rule. A rule whose message no test ever observes has no red case: its suite is
green for a reason unrelated to whether the rule works. That is a control that
cannot fail, one level up -- in the tests rather than in the guard.

How a script opts in. Declare a module-level `FINDING_KINDS` mapping of rule
name to the message fragment that rule emits, and format the messages from it so
the two cannot drift. Scripts declaring none are skipped and counted, so adding
this check to a repository fails nothing that has not opted in.

Nothing about any repository's layout is assumed. Subjects and test
directories are given as arguments. When `--tests` is omitted the script looks
for a `tests/` directory beside the subject's skill and at the invocation root,
and the report names what it considered -- silence about the candidate set is
what turns a heuristic into a false clean.

What this is not. It is a floor. A test source containing a fragment is not
proof that an assertion fires, and only executing the case proves the branch is
reachable. It catches the absent red case, which is cheap; branch coverage
catches the unreachable one, which is not.

Usage:
    python lint-finding-coverage.py <subject.py> [<subject.py> ...] [--tests DIR]
    python lint-finding-coverage.py --discover <root>

Exit codes: '0' no findings, including when every subject declared no
catalogue and was skipped as not opted in; '1' at least one finding, which
includes a discovery scan where no subject declared one at all; '2' the check
could not run -- a subject path outside the invocation root.
