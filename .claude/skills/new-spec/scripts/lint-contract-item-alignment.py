"""Check that a loop contract's items line up: identifiers, references, coverage.

Scope is deliberately narrow. This decides *item alignment* inside one spec
directory and owns no lifecycle question -- status vocabulary, ship transitions,
deferral anchors and contract traceability belong to the spec-status lint, and
duplicating them here would put two homes on one obligation.

The rules, all mechanical:

  1. every acceptance criterion carries a well-formed identifier
  2. identifiers are unique within the spec directory
  3. no identifier appears in the retired list
  4. every criterion-class reference in spec.md and plan.md resolves
  5. every criterion is named by at least one task *entry*
  6. every criterion appears in exactly one verification group
  7. a verification item's identifier is its own, not derived from what it serves
  8. no task entry leaves a code span open, which is how a multi-site edit
     truncates a closing condition without making it look truncated
  9. given a base revision, no criterion was reworded while the assertion blocks
     naming it stayed put -- a criterion whose assertion did not follow it

Rule 5 is scoped to task entries -- a task's 'Tests:' and 'Done when:'
blocks -- and not to the whole document. The weaker form, "does this identifier
appear anywhere in plan.md", passes on a mention in prose, in a changelog, or in
another task's rationale, so a criterion with no implementing bullet anywhere
reads as covered.

Forward-only by construction: a spec whose criteria carry no identifiers is
skipped entirely, so introducing this check does not fail a corpus authored
before the convention existed.

Exit codes: '0' no failing findings -- which includes a run where a reporting
rule flagged something, since those are printed as "reported, not failing" and
never set the status; '1' at least one failing finding; '2' the check could
not run, which is only a spec directory outside the invocation root; a directory
with no 'spec.md' is a finding, not a refusal.

Rule 9 is the reporting rule. It over-reports by construction, so a non-zero
exit on it would fail a build for a prose edit.
