"""Answer "what already governs these paths?" before a spec or plan is authored.

Probes, seeded by the paths a change will touch, selected by stage. The cost is bounded by the
seed set and its references rather than by the repository, which is the whole
difference from a repository map: a map's cost scales with the repository and its
token budget truncates exactly the rare edge you needed.

  scoped rules   which governing files sit above a seed, root-ward
  path refs      which files name a seed path
  phrase pins    which files quote a distinctive line from a seed file
  gates          which runners would execute a seed path
  co-change      which files historically move with a seed path
  surfaces       which known grounding surfaces exist, and carry content
  dead refs      which paths a seed names that no longer resolve

`--phase` selects the set a stage needs: at discovery nothing is authored yet, so
a dead-reference scan returns a reassuring empty result; at review the artifacts
are the seeds and their references are the question.

Three rules hold for every probe.

**It reports; it never decides.** Blocking on a heuristic is a different
mechanism with a different failure mode, and a worse one.

Exit codes: '0' always, including when every probe found nothing or an input
was unavailable -- an unreadable seed degrades to an 'unavailable' outcome, it
does not fail the run; '2' only when a seed path escapes the invocation root,
which is the one condition that stops the tool. There is no code for "found
something", because a finding here is never a failure.

**Outcomes are always distinguishable, but there are not always three.** A probe
whose input can be missing has three -- found, none found, and input unavailable
-- because a probe that returns empty when its input is missing is
indistinguishable from a clean result, and co-change in particular has no
fallback, so on a repository without history it must say so rather than say
nothing. The probes that read the tree itself -- scoped rules, path refs and the
surface inventory -- have two: their input cannot be absent, and claiming a third
outcome they cannot reach would describe a set the code does not have.

**Nothing about this repository is hardcoded.** Top-level names and the tracked
set are derived at run time. A shipped allowlist of directories fails on an
adopter's first run by finding nothing, silently, forever.
